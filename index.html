                    was unable to get any time to actually work on the robot. I started my own FTC team the next year,
                    recruiting some friends to join. We all got to have significant contributions to the robot ourselves
                    and managed to reach the regional competition.

                    about collaborating with others, and being the president, I was responsible for making sure everyone
                    worked at their own pace. We use blender and Unreal engine to create visually enticing games.

                    work-in-progress social media site built on the Django python web

                    utilizes java to build android applications

                    Watch render. I have experience with 3D modelling and rendering, and this is one of my renders. I
                    modeled my watch and textured completely using only blender. This tested my modeling and texturing
                    capabilities. <br>

                    Nature render. This render was challenging for me because of the intense number of vertices and
                    images, making it nearly impossible to render on my low end computer. Using various optimization
                    methods, I produced this render at 2 samples. <br>

                  I have skills ranging from web development to robotics. Here is a list
                  of my most valuable skills.
                </p>
                <ul class="skills-list">
                  <li>
                    Robotics. In my 6 years of FIRST robotics experience, I have learned a LOT about robotics. I have
                    experience in circuits, construction, fabricating, software and CAD.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Git/Github. I have experience with the basics of git such as pushing,
                    pulling, branches and files like .gitignore or .gitattributes. I also
                    know how to use github to make pull requests, raise issues or publish
                    releases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Python. Python is my primary language, and I use it for most of my projects. I have a good knowledge
                    of python syntax and how to use different modules.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Java. I am learning Java in my AP computer science class, and I have experience with it in robotics.
                    In my robotics, we use Java to build android applications to control the motors and sensors.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    HTML/CSS. I have a lot of experience with HTML and CSS through my 4 or so attempts at making a
                    portfolio website from scratch. This is it, and showcases my skill of making static sites. I know
                    how to use bootstrap to make responsive web pages and templates.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Django. I am currently using the Django python web framework to build a social media website. I tie
                    this in with HTML templates to build dynamic websites. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Windows. My primary operating system, I am familiar with modifying system environment variables and 
                    using PowerShell. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    C. I am currently learning C so that I can make better contributions to Blender and the Linux kernel.
                    I'll post some projects when I make something interesting.
